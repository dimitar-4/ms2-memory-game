with the "Play" and "Exo" Google fonts to further point the project in the desired visual direction. The
background images are chosen according to the character of the game.

## Testing

### UX Testing
 
 By opening Car Brans Memory Game a simple easy to read entering or home page is displayed.
 The text is easy to read with good contrast to the backgraund. 
 
 Home page contains: 
 1. A Title for the game that is also a link to the game page.  
 2. "How To Play" title followed by a simple instuctions list of how to play the game, and a TIP at the end explaining how to change the theme in the game page. 
 3. Play button that is big and easy to find directly when enter the page.
 4. At the bottom of the page there is a kind sentance thanking the player for playing.

 By opening the game page a realy nice and simple layout of is loaded. The name of the game is on top. 
 Under the name there is a 60 seconds timer that starts when a card is clicked. Next to the timer is the restart game buttom. 
 Under that is the gameboard of 16 cards in a square shape. At the bottom are the change theme buttons. 
 Tha layout of the page is simple and easy to use.

 While playing the memory game, the player's focus is grabbed quickly. When the game is won a window is opening and saying "YOU WIN". 
 It is the same when the time is up but the window says "Times Up". It is helping to train 
 concentration and memory. It is also very interesting when the player is someone who likes specific car brand 
 or the idea of playing a memomry game with car brands logos. The player can be focused and at the same time relaxed 
 while playing.  

 The game was tested also from famaly and friends. All share the UX testing above and there were opinions that it's catchy and easy to forget 
 everything and enjoy a number af games at a time.
